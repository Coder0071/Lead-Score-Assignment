### _Business Goal:_
_X Education sells online courses to industry professionals. The company markets its courses on websites and search engines like google.  Once these people land on the websites, they might browse the course or fill up a form for the course or watch some videos. When these people fill up a form providing their email address or phone number, they are classified to be a lead. Moreover, the company also gets leads through past referrals. Once these leads are acquired, employees from
the sales team start making calls, writing emails, etc. Through this process, some of the leads get converted while most do not. The typical lead conversion rate at X education is around 30%. The CEO, in particular, has given a ballpark of the target lead conversion rate to be around 80%._



### _Problem Statement:_
_Identify the sets of leads of X Education company so that the lead conversion rate should go up so the sales team of the company could focus more on communicating with the potential leads (Hot leads) rather than approaching each and every customer which in turn would help them in paying more attention to the
customers that are more likely to purchase their product/course. The company needs a model where in it assigns a lead score to each of the leads such that the customers with high lead score have a higher conversion rate & the customer with lower lead score have a lower conversion rate_
